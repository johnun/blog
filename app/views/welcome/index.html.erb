    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi! I am John Un, an aspiring coder on my personal journey to the programming promise land.</p>
    <p>This journal is to document my learning journey as I try to follow in the footsteps of all the great coders out there. I have always found myself dabbling in new ventures but failing to give it my all and following through with all my heart. This journal is my attempt to document my learnings, my thought processes along the way, my doubts, and my inner struggles.</p>
    <p>Hopefully by documenting the entire process, i can see the journey more clearly for myself, see how much effort i have put in, and push myself to keep going. Maybe one day, I'll be able to look back, seeing how far I have come, smile, and give myself a pat on the back. But until then, the journey continues...</p>
    <p>Please say <a href="#"><%= link_to "hello", new_contact_path %></a> if you stumble upon this site as the journey can be lonely sometimes.</p>
